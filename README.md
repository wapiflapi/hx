It's possible this **might not render well on some terminal configurations**. It
uses black and bold black to render null bytes and other non printable
characters; if those colors are actually black on a black background with your
configuration then you won't see them. Change your color configuration to
something more useful or submit a PR with a smarter solution, that will be
appreciated.
